### 🚀 Dynamic Waiting Weight Algorithm Explained

#### 🎯 Core Innovation: S1/S2_Dynamic_Waiting

**Algorithm Principle:**
```python
# 1. Calculate waiting intensity
waiting_intensity = tanh(max_waiting * steepness / transition_point)

# 2. Dynamically adjust weights
# S1 version:
progressive_w_a = w_a * (0.2 + 2.3 * waiting_intensity) # 0.2x → 2.5x
progressive_w_b = w_b * (1.8 - 1.5 * waiting_intensity) # 1.8x → 0.3x

# S2 version:
progressive_w_a = w_a * (0.1 + 2.4 * waiting_intensity) # 0.1x → 2.5x
progressive_w_b = w_b * (1.5 - 1.1 * waiting_intensity) # 1.5x → 0.4x
progressive_w_g = w_g * (1.4 - 0.8 * waiting_intensity) # 1.4x → 0.6x
```

**Weight Change Scenarios:**

| Scenario | S1_Dynamic_Waiting Weight Change | S2_Dynamic_Waiting Weight Change |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| No waiting (max_waiting=0) | 0.2×waiting + 1.8×cache (mainly relies on cache) | 0.1×waiting + 1.5×cache + 1.4×running |
| Mild waiting (max_waiting=15) | ~0.8×waiting + 1.2×cache (starts to balance) | ~1.0×waiting + 1.0×cache + 1.0×running |
| Heavy waiting (max_waiting≥60) | 2.5×waiting + 0.3×cache (mainly relies on waiting) | 2.5×waiting + 0.4×cache + 0.6×running |

**Configuration Parameters:**
- `transition_point`: Transition point, default 30 waiting requests
- `steepness`: Controls transition smoothness, default 1.0

### 🔧 **Weight Configuration Guidelines**

#### **Waiting Weight (w_a) Configuration:**
```
w_a = 0.1 # waiting is often 0, rely on other metrics
w_a = 0.2-0.3 # waiting appears occasionally, needs some weight
w_a = 0.4-0.5 # waiting appears frequently, needs balanced weight
w_a = 0.6+ # waiting is the main discriminating metric
```

#### **Cache Weight (w_b) Configuration:**
```
w_b = 0.9 # cache is the main discriminator (when waiting=0)
w_b = 0.7-0.8 # cache is one of the important metrics
w_b = 0.4-0.6 # cache is balanced with other metrics
w_b = 0.3- # cache difference is small, lower the weight
```

#### **Running Weight (w_g) Configuration:**
```
w_g = 0.4 # running is the main discriminating metric
w_g = 0.3 # running is an important metric
w_g = 0.2 # running is an auxiliary metric
w_g = 0.1 # running difference is small
```

### 🎯 **Algorithm Selection Decision Tree**
